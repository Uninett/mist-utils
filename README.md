# Scripts:

* check_env.py - check if our env is set up to use the Mist API
* token_create.py - create an API token
* token_lisy.py - list the token we currently have created
* simple_summary.py - very simple overview listing of your org
* token_tidy.py - tidy up our tokens by removing all except the token we are currently using

# Usage
